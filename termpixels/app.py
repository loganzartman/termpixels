"""A utility for building complete terminal applications.

The App class wires together various components of termpixels to provide a
complete platform for building terminal applications. It provides the following
pre-built instances as member variables:
    - backend: provides output (rendering) capabilities
    - input: provides input (keyboard, mouse, etc.) capabilities
    - screen: provides higher-level interface for printing text, filling areas,
              reading characters, etc.

The App class is generally used by extending it and overriding special event
handler methods to implement the application's business logic. An instance of
the subclass is constructed, and then the start() method is called on it, e.g.

Usage:
    class MyApp(App):
        def on_frame(self):
            ...
        ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        MyApp().start()
